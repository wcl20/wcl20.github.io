# Hierarchical Behavioral Repertoires with Unsupervised Descriptors

## Overview
* Presents hierarchical behavioral repertoires that stack several hevacioral repertoires to generate sophisticated behaviors.
* Introduces a novel approach to automatically define behavioral descriptors using unsupervised neural network. 

## Related Work

### Behavioral Repertoire Evolution
* A BR is a set of simple controllers that governs the motor commands sent to the robot.
* The original BR-evolution paper suggested that BRs can be combined with a high-level algorithm.
* One limitation of BRs is that a dierent controller is required for each of the behaviors that the robot may have to execute. Thus the size of the BR rapidly increases up to a point of being intractable.

### Quality Diversity Optimization
* QD optimization aims to produce a large collection of solutions that are both diverse and high-performing.
* The Novelty Search with Local Competition (NSLC) and MAP-Elites are the two main QD-algorithms.

### Innovation Engines
* One of the strengths of deep neural networks is their ability to automatically extract features for the recognition of objects from complex data, like images or videos.
* Innovative engines use this ability to automatically associate the behavioral descriptor of the solutions created by the QD-algorithms to the labels predicted by the network.

## Content

### Hierarchical Behavioral Repertoires
* We can not increase the versatility of robots with BR by simply adding more and more dimensions to the repertoire. This likely leads to an exponential growth of the repertoire size, which might become intractable, dilute the selective pressure, and thus deteriorate the quality of the produced solutions.
* The proposed Hierarchical Behavioral Repertoires leverage the diversity of controllers from the repertoires in the dierent levels of the hierarchy to build complex behaviors, while maintaining the overall complexity of the architecture tractable. 
* HBR involves using several BRs that are stacked in a hierarchical architecture. We propose to use another BR to select and combine behaviors from the first BR.
* One challenge with HBRs is that chaining behavior executions make them start from arbitrary initial conditions. To overcome this problem:
  - We propose to use a stochastic behavioral descriptor to characterize the probabilistic distribution of the robot’s behavior.
  - During evaluation, the controller is evaluated several times (e.g., 100 times) with different initial conditions. For each of these evaluations, the traditional behavioral descriptor is recorded. When all the evaluations have been performed, the geometric median of the descriptors is computed.
  - This stochastic behavioral descriptor is then used as a traditional descriptor to place the individual in the repertoire.
* HBR composed of four layers:
  - The first layer enables the robots to reach every point in their reachable space. (Stochastic behvioral descriptor)
  - The second layer enables the robots to draw lines of different lengths and directions by connecting two points from the first layer. (Stochastic behvioral descriptor)
  - The third layer combines five lines from the second layer to empower the robot with the ability to draw arcs of different lengths, radius and orientations.
  - The fourth layer grants the robots the ability to draw digits by concatenating arcs and lines from the lower layers.

### Automatic Behavioral Descriptors
* A deep neural network trained in an unsupervised fashion can be used to automatically define behavioral descriptors.
* We use this approach to definne the descriptors of the fourth layer of the hierarchy.
* We propose to use a convolutional deep autoencoder, which enables the construction of a behavioral descriptor in a fully unsupervised manner.
* The role of the autoencoder is to jointly train an encoder learns to encode the input data and a decoder to reconstruct it.
* We use it to automatically project high-dimensional data from the observed behaviors (e.g., trajectories, sensor data) into a low dimensional representation that can be used as a behavioral descriptor.

## Experiment

### Robotic Arm
* We use the proposed HBR to enable our robotic arm to learn how to draw digits.
* This experiment illustrates the ability of the HBR to evolve behaviors of increasing complexity through the layers of the hierarchy. 
* The performance of the traditional BRs remains 2.3 times lower than the last layer of HBRs.
* We can first observe that the hierarchy reduces the total length of the genotypes. Reducing the dimensionality of the search space usually reduces the difficulty of the optimization task.

### Quality Propagation
* One important property of HBR is the ability to propagate the quality of solutions from a layer through the upper-layers of the architecture.
* We show we can substitute layers of the hierarchy with BRs using different fitness function as long as the behavioral descriptor denfition remains the same.
* In the experiment, we generate a new Layer 1, which instead of minimizing the variance between the angular positions of the robot's joints, encourages the robot to use only two of its joints for the motion.
* This result illustrates that changing one layer enables the robot to instantaneously switch the proficiency of the hierarchy, without further evolution of the system.

### Knowledge Transfer
* One important property of HBR is the possibility to transfer the knowledge of our robotic arm to another robot.
* We generate a Layer 1 designed for a different robot.
* As long as the new layer entirely overlaps the region of the behavioral descriptor covered by the original layer, the rest of the hierarchy can be directly used with the new robot without any adaptation.

### Stochastic Behavioral Descriptors
* To investigate whether the number of samples used for the computation of the stochastic descriptors has an inuences on the results.
* The results show that using a stochastic descriptor reduces the number of controllers in the BRs by several orders of magnitude.
* In terms of accuracy, the HBRs with at least 10 samples are at least twice more accurate than the traditional BR.

## Future Work
* Can Hierarchical structures help cross the reality gap. If the first layer is made to cross the reality gap, does it enable the rest of the hierarchy to cross it too.
