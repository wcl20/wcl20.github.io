# Quality Diversity: A New Frontier for Evolutionary Computation

## Overview
* Study the application of QD algorithms in challenging environments
* Providing insights into migitatation of BC misalignment

## Related Work

### Multi-Modal Function Optimization
* The aim of MMFO is to discover multiple local optima within a search space, which naturally yields a diversity of solutions.
* Different from QD, it focuses on genotype diversity instead of phenotype diversity

### Multi-Objective Optimization
*  In MOO, the search algorithm aims to uncover the key trade-offs (called the Pareto front) among two or more objectives set by the user.
*  Similar to QD, MOO returns a set of top candidates rather than a single winner, but MOO is still ultimately driven toward specific objectives (though more than one) and therefore intrinsically convergent.

### Novelty Search
* It showed that searching divergently instead of convergently can sometimes sidestep deception to uncover desirable parts of the search space.
* A missing ingredient from pure novelty or behavioral diversity techniques is a complementary notion of objective quality.

### Quality Diversity Algorithms
* The goal of QD is to uncover as many diverse behavioral niches as possible, but where each niche is represented by a candidate of the highest possible quality for that niche. 
* The original QD algorithm of this type, called novelty search with local competition (NSLC), hybridizes novelty search with local fitness competitions only among individuals with similar behaviors, yielding a broad population of numerous simultaneous local competitions in diverse behavioral niches 
* An alternate QD algorithm called multi-dimensional archive of phenotypic elites (MAP-Elites) 


## Content
* Contrary to the tendency of optimization algorithms to converge over time to a single "best" solution, natural evolution instead exhibits a remarkable tendency toward divergence
* Inspired by this alternate view of natural evolution's apparent strength as a diversifier, a new evolutionary algorithm called novelty search was introduced
* The goal of Quality Diversity algorithms is to find a maximally diverse collection of individuals in which each member is as high performing as possible
* The aim of this paper is to establish a standard framework for understanding and comparing different approaches to searching for QD
* A method for mitigating the effects of BC misalignment is to drive search with multiple BCs simultaneously

### Behavior Characteristic Alignment
* A key concept in any QD algorithm is the behavior characterization (BC), which is usually a vector that describes the chronology of actions taken by an individual during its evaluation but can also describe other salient aspects of an individual's behavior
* An important property of the BC is its alignment with the notion of quality, which refers to the degree to which finding novelty tends also to lead to higher fitness
* A previous study of QD finds that unaligned BCs often lead to a slower discovery of passable solutions

## Experiment
* In the experiments described in this paper, simulated wheeled robots navigate mazes of varying complexity. 
* Successfully navigating a maze can be challenging because it requires learning a complex mapping between sensors and effectors
* An important feature of all three mazes is the deceptive trap
* Experiment algorithms:
	- NSLC
	- MAP-Elites
	- MAP-Elites with Novelty: making selection proportional to novelty
	- MAP-Elites with passive genetic diversity: saves two individuals in each bin instead of one
	- Multi BC NSLC
	- Multi BC NS
	- Multi BC MAP-Elites
	- Multi BC MAP-Elites with Novelty
* Two controls are used in this study
	- Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)
	- Novelty Search
*  The experiments in this article explore two BCs:
	- EndpointBC (highly aligned)
	- DirectionBC (highly misaligned)
* QD algorithms following the compass of an unaligned BC are incrementally less able to find QD as the level of deception increases from one maze to another
* Searching for diversity with respect to an unaligned BC does not circumvent the problem of deception
* Multi-BC algorithms allow search to be driven both by the desired notion of diversity and a separate BC that is well equipped to circumvent deception.
* BCs that are aligned with the notion of quality (such as EndpointBC in this study) are the key ingredient to overcoming deception on difficult problems.

## Future Work
* An alternative approach not tested in this study is to simply concatenate both an aligned and unaligned BC into a single BC with more dimensions
